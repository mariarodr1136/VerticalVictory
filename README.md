## Overview
VerticalVictory is a fun and interactive implementation of the classic **Connect 4** game. Players take turns dropping their discs into a grid with the objective of connecting four of their discs in a row‚Äîhorizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is won when a player achieves this connection, or when the grid is full without a winner (a draw).

This project was built using **C++** and **SFML** for graphical user interface (GUI) rendering. The game provides a visually appealing experience with real-time interaction.
